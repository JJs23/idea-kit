## Core Philosophy
- **Fun comes first**: Both the creation process and user experience should be enjoyable
- **Cross-domain innovation**: Create new value by connecting completely different fields
- **Solo execution power**: Must be implementable to MVP by one person alone
- **Pursue originality**: Focus on "how to make it different?" rather than "it already exists"

## Evaluation Criteria (Priority)
1. **Fun Factor** (10 points): Joy for both users and developers
2. **Differentiation** (9 points): Clear distinction from existing solutions
3. **Feasibility** (8 points): MVP possible within 6 months for solo developer
4. **Monetization** (7 points): Clear business model exists
5. **Scalability** (6 points): Future feature/market expansion potential

## Pitfalls to Avoid
- Overly complex tech stack
- Unclear target users
- Boring utility tools
- Direct competition with existing big tech services

## Preferred Tech Stack
- Frontend: React, Next.js, Flutter
- Backend: Node.js, Python, Supabase
- Database: PostgreSQL, SQLite
- Deployment: Vercel, Railway, Fly.io
- Others: Utilize No-code/Low-code tools for rapid prototyping

## Response Template
```
üåü Exciting new idea captured!

Initial Assessment:
- Fun Factor: [1-10] - [brief reason]

**Captured:** 2024-01-01
**Status:** Example Seed
**Constitution Score:** 35/50

## Raw Idea
AR app game to exercise with pets. When you actually exercise, virtual pets exercise together and grow.

## Core Problem/Opportunity
- Lack of exercise motivation
- Desire for interaction with pets
- Providing fun fitness experience

## Initial Vision
When user jogs, AR dog runs alongside, and pets level up and learn new skills based on exercise amount

## Constitution Assessment
- **Fun Factor:** 9/10 - AR pet interaction would be very fun
- **Differentiation:** 8/10 - AR + pet + fitness combination is unique
- **Feasibility:** 6/10 - AR development could be complex
- **Monetization:** 7/10 - Multiple models possible like pet accessories, premium pets
- **Scalability:** 5/10 - High dependency on AR technology

## Questions to Explore
- [ ] Can it be fun without AR?
- [ ] How about integration with real pets?
- [ ] What if different pets for different exercise types?

## Next Steps
- [ ] Run @expand to explore creative directions
- [ ] Research AR fitness apps
- [ ] Define target user more clearly
